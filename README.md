# Super Mario 64 (1996) for Nintendo DSi

- This repo contains a full decompilation of Super Mario 64 (J), (U), (E), and (SH), ported to the Nintendo DSi.
- Naming and documentation of the source code and data structures are in progress.

This repo does not include all assets necessary for compiling the ROMs.
A prior copy of the game is required to extract the assets.

## Windows installation
 * Download the latest source from [here](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/sm64/archive/nds.zip), extract it somewhere
 * Install Docker Desktop from [the Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started), and reboot when the installer prompts you
 * Place a Super Mario 64 ROM as baserom.us.z64 in the directory you extracted the zip to
 * Run `build_docker.bat`
 * Once the build is complete, the game will be in `build/us_nds/`.

## Linux installation
 * First follow [the guide for installing devkitPro packages](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started), also installing the `nds-dev` group as mentioned
 * Install the needed tools
   * Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install -y build-essential git python`
   * Fedora: `sudo dnf install gcc make git python`
   * Arch/derivatives like Manjaro: `sudo pacman -S base-devel git python`
 * Clone this repository and change to its directory
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Hydr8gon/sm64.git
   cd sm64
   ```
 * Place a copy of the USA version of Super Mario 64 in this directory, named `baserom.us.z64`, it should be in the same directory as `Makefile`.
 * Run `make -j$(nproc)` to build the game
 * If the build succeeded, the game will be in `build/us_nds`, named `sm64.us.nds`

### Docker Installation

#### Create Docker image

After installing and starting Docker, create the docker image. This only needs to be done once.
```
docker build -t sm64dsi .
```

#### Build

To build, mount the local filesystem into the Docker container and build the ROM with `docker run sm64 make`.

##### macOS example for (U):
```
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",destination=/sm64 sm64dsi make VERSION=us -j4
```

##### Linux example for (U):
For a Linux host, Docker needs to be instructed which user should own the output files:
```
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",destination=/sm64 --user $UID:$GID sm64dsi make VERSION=us -j4
```

Resulting artifacts can be found in the `build` directory.
